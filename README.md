# Hey, I’m Rufat 👋

## 🧠 What I’m Into

- 🧱 **Platform Engineering & DevOps** — Kubernetes-first platforms, Helm, Terraform, GitOps, and making ops feel boring (in a good way).
- ☁️ **Cloud + Homelab Building** — Proxmox labs, cluster tinkering, networking, storage, and “make it real” infrastructure.
- 🤖 **Automation & CI/CD** — Runners, pipelines, and workflows that reduce friction and keep teams moving.
- 🧰 **Tools & Developer UX** — CLIs, utilities, and “one-command” experiences that make repeatable work actually repeatable.
- 🖥️ **TUIs** — Terminal interfaces that don’t feel like punishment.
- 🧑‍💻 **Go + Backend Services** — APIs, workers, integrations, and small services that do one job well.
- 🧪 **Side Quests** — The occasional full-stack UI or hardware/IoT detour when curiosity wins.

I like building things I actually use — **sometimes boring in production**, but **always interesting to build**.
