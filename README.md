# Hey, I’m Rufat 👋

## 🧠 What I’m Into

- Platforms & Infrastructure
- Developer tooling & CLIs
- TUIs, automation, CI/CD
- Backend work (mostly Go) and the occasional full-stack thing
- Hardware / IoT when curiosity wins

I like building things I use — **sometimes boring in production**, but **always
interesting to build**.

## 🧩 Open-Source Projects

These are projects I maintain and care about long-term:

- **signum** — SVG badge generator with no strings attached
- **cradle** — CLI to build and launch Docker images with a consistent,
  pre-configured setup

(see pinned repos 👇)

## 🧪 Labs & Experiments

This account also contains side projects, spikes, and experiments — often born
in my homelab:

- Infrastructure labs
- Tooling ideas
- Half-finished prototypes
- Things I built to understand something better

They’re intentionally not all polished — that’s the point.

## 🛠️ Things I Tend to Reach For

Go · Kubernetes · Terraform · Linux · GitHub Actions
…but I’m always poking at new tools if they look interesting.
